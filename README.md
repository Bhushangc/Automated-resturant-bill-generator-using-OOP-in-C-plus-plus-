# Automated-resturant-bill-generator-using-OOP-in-C++-
The main goal of this project was to properly learn object oriented programming
In this project I created a automated billing system for a restaurant using c++
Problem Specification: 
You are required to create an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) to take customer orders for a local ethnic food restaurant in Kathmandu. The restaurant offers 10 different types of food dishes, taken from the local ethnic food culture. The restaurant operates with limited dishes and limited staff. You are required to create a prototype of order taking system to ease the working process within the restaurant. Your program should have the following functionalities: 
1.	The program should display the menu at the start (with 10 dishes). These dishes should be stored in a text file as shown below. Your program should load these dishes by reading this file: 
//Text file should have
MoMo Steam – 150
MoMo Fried - 170
Chowmein – 175
Bhutan – 195
Chhoila – 205
Cold Drinks – 75
Khaja Set – 195
Bara Set – 115
Fried Rice – 125
Omelette - 45

2.	Each customer will make an order based on the menu shown. For each order, the system should calculate the total bill. For each bill, after adding the sum total of the prices of the dishes, the sum total would be subject to 10% service Tax and 13% VAT. 
3.	For every new instance where a customer (new or repeating) makes an order, a new bill is generated. 
4.	Altering a confirmed order would not be a necessary feature for the MVP phase of the system. 
5.	Your program should save the total order amount and total order count for each day in a separate file.
